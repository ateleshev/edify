0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Forwarding and
       consolidation summary message (IFCSUM) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to be used for consolidation purposes from a party
       arranging forwarding and transport services to the party for which
       the transport of the consolidated cargo is destined.
       The message can be used to exchange information concerning the
       consolidated cargo between forwarders, carriers and agents enabling
       those parties to handle the consignments included in this
       consolidation.
       In addition it can be used for a collection of consignments
       originating from one shipper for forwarding and transport services.
       In addition it can be used for an advice of insurance related to a
       consolidation of consignments if the insured is the party arranging
       forwarding and transport services.

1.2    Field of application

       The Forwarding and consolidation summary message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The IFCSUM message is a functionality in its own right,
       distinguishable from the transport booking and instruction messages.
       IFCSUM focuses on separate business areas in transport where the
       view on the operations is transport means or equipment oriented
       rather than consignment oriented. These business areas do not
       concentrate on concepts like booking or instruction. The IFCSUM
       provides currently merely a statement for a means of transport or
       equipment and their summary type information regarding the
       consignment carried. The IFCSUM message also provides a means to
       incorporate the control and auditability information needed for the
       receiver of the message to perform the operation to be carried out.
       
       IFCSUM is foreseen to be used:
       - in the consolidation and deconsolidation industry (stuffing and
       stripping of consignments in containers)
       - in the groupage and degroupage industry (the full load description
       of rail-cars and road vehicles)
       - in the collection and distribution industry (as the description of
       all consignments to be collected together (maybe from different
       places) and delivered at possibly different places in a certain
       region)
       - for the declaration of dangerous cargo by ship's agents to their
       Port Authorities (as listing of the dangerous cargo carried or to be
       carried by as means of transport).
       
       The message provides information concerning cargo carried on a
       voyage specifying details regarding carrier, mode of transport,
       means of transport, equipment and the necessary details of the
       consignments included in the consolidated cargo.
       Under given circumstances a cargo manifest can be obtained through
       the use of the IFCSUM.
       For example, a IFCSUM message can be used in groupage traffic, where
       it may correspond to a loading list indicating the consignments that
       have been loaded on a truck.
       
       There is a need for FUNCTIONAL SUBSETS to be derived from the
       message, for example:
       
       - CONSOLIDATION ADVICE giving information about the departure of a
       voyage/flight or consolidation to the receiver.
       
       - CONSOLIDATION STATUS giving information about the departure of a
       voyage/flight or consolidation to principals (e.g. carrier to
       freight forwarder, consolidator to co-loader etc.).
       
       - CONSOLIDATION REPORT giving information about the arrival and
       unloading, clearance, etc. from the receiver to the sender.
       According to the different information requirements of carriers,
       carrier's agents, and freight forwarders for the different modes of
       transport like air, deep sea, inland waterways, rail, road,
       combined- and/or multimodal- transport different modal subsets can
       be derived from this message.
       
       There is a need for INTRAMODAL SUBSETS to be transmitted between
       partners of the same mode of transport (e.g. railway to railway in
       different countries, deep-sea-carrier to deep-sea carrier, freight
       forwarder to freight forwarder etc.).
       
       There is another need for INTERMODAL SUBSETS to be transmitted
       between partners in a multimodal transport (e.g. freight forwarder
       to trucker, trucker to railway, railway to port authority, port
       authority to carrier's agent, carrier's agent to carrier etc.).
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in
       one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified
       with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a
       temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on
       another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to
       or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a
       container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group. Other load
       or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up
       to three levels.
       
       For insurance purposes the message can be used by the carrier to
       inform the insurer and/or the insurance intermediary about a
       consolidation of consignments.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.

                          FTX-GDS-SG32-SG33-SG34-SG35-SG37-SG38-SG39-SG40-
                          SG46-SG53-SG73
        A segment group to give information about all consignments included
        in a voyage/flight or consolidation. The segment group can be used
        in two different manners to serve different approaches to
        consolidate messages: 
        
        - Short form consolidation message
        
        In this situation, single consignment based functional messages
        (e.g. booking and/or instruction messages) have been sent on a
        progressive basis between exchanging partners (e.g. freight
        forwarder on the export side to freight forwarder on the import
        side).
        When the loading of the vessel/aircraft or consolidation is
        complete the IFCSUM-message will be sent and will use the CNI-
        segments to identify the transport document/message number (e.g.
        bill of lading, air-way bill, etc.) of every consignment, the
        details of which have already been sent as separate single
        consignment based messages (e.g. booking and/or instruction
        messages) or which will be sent as separate single consignment
        based messages following the IFCSUM-message using the option of
        grouping with the UNG-service-segment in a transmission.
        When the carrier himself loads consignments in a container or ULD
        the segment SGP and/or TPL following the CNI can be used to
        indicate in which equipment specified in the EQD-group on top level
        and/or which means of transport specified in the TDT-group on top
        level the consignment is loaded.
        
        Thus the short form IFCSUM-message operates as a reconciliation and
        control statement.
        
        - Extended form consolidation message
        
        In this situation, the data for each individual consignment has NOT
        been sent to the receiving partner by means of single consignment
        based messages (e.g. booking and/or instruction messages) separate
        to the IFCSUM message. In these circumstances it is possible to
        include the details of each consignment into the IFCSUM-message. In
        that case the segment (group) SGP and TPL following the segment CNI
        will not be used. For every consignment the complete structure of a
        single consignment based message can be used starting with the
        segment CNI replacing the BGM.
        
        Thus the extended form IFCSUM-message has not the function of
        referencing but to show as full a set of consignment data as is
        necessary to meet the requirements of type of consolidation message
        being constructed, e.g. Cargo vs. Full Freight.

01180      CNI, Consignment information
           A segment to indicate consignments included in the consolidation
           using the transport document/message number or to replace the
